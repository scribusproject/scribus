BUILDING SCRIBUS ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS WITH MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO
==================================================================

This documentation is minimal and assume you have a decent knowledge of 
Microsoft Visual Studio. No help regarding use of Visual Studio and
related tools will be provided.

You will need:
	- Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, 7 or a more recent version
	- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (for 32bit build) or Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 (for 32/64bit build)
	- A recent Qt release built with corresponding Visual Studio version (version >= 4.6)
	- Common libraries kit downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus-libs/
	- Scribus 14x libraries kit downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus-libs/
	
It is possible to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or 2012 Express editions. However in the case of Microsoft
Visual Studio 2008 Express, SP1 is required in order to build the dependency archive.

GETTING DEPENDENCIES
====================

This is a quick and dirty set of notes that will be filled out once everything's
verified as correct and working. It assumes that you'll be building all your
dependencies at a single root, like C:\Developer. The root *MUST NOT* have spaces
in its path.


Building Qt:
------------

Download the latest Qt 4 release from http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/ and unpack it to C:\Developer.

Start a command line and import your Visual Studio environment:
\path\to\visual\studio\VC\vcvarsall.bat x86 (for 32bit build)
or 
\path\to\visual\studio\VC\vcvarsall.bat x86_amd64 (for 64bit build)

Note: with Visual Studio Express Editions, it is not possible to compile in 64bit mode prior to Visual Studio 2012.

now cd to C:\Developer\qt-everywhere-whatever and run configure:
	- Visuak Studio 2008 : configure -platform win32-msvc2008 -debug-and-release -no-qt3support -no-webkit -no-script -noscripttools 
	- Visuak Studio 2012 : configure -platform win32-msvc2012 -debug-and-release -no-qt3support -no-webkit -no-script -noscripttools 

After configure has finished its work, run nmake.

You can remove the -no-webkit -no-script -noscripttools options if you desire to make a complete build of Qt. Be aware however that 
Qt build times will be much (much) increased without additional benefit for Scribus.

After Qt has finished building, you can type following command to get rid of temporary objects:
del *.obj *.ilk /s

Building 3rd party libraries:
-----------------------------

Archives with ready-to-build solutions for scribus dependencies have been made available on sourceforge. These archives can be used to
compile all dependencies necessary for Scribus.

Two different archives are needed :
	- common libraries for 14x and trunk : contains boost and python, no compilation is required here
	- Scribus 14x specified libraries : libraries used to compile current Scribus 1.4.x releases

Common libraries and version specific libraries can be downloaded on Sourceforge from this directory:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus-libs/

Common libraries are named with following scheme : scribus-commmon-libs-XXXXXX where XXXXX represents a date.
Archives with version specific libraries are named using following scheme scribus-14x-libs-msvcXXXX-XXXXXX where :
	- msvcXXXX represent the Visual Studio version needed to compile provided Visual Studio solution
	- XXXXXX is a series of numbers representing a date.

For building 14x, archives are provided for Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2012. The Visual Studio 2008 archives allows to build 
libraries targeted at Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP and more recent Windows systems. The Visual Studio 2012 archives allows to build 
libraries for 32bit and 64bit platforms. Produced binaries can be used on Windows Vista and up. If you plan to use a more recent 
Visual Studio version than Visual Studio 2012, download the archives for Visual Studio 2012.

Once you downloaded the two appropriate archives :
	- decompress them in the *same* directory.
	- open the visual studio solution (*.sln) located in the scribus-1.4.x-libs-* directory
	- build debug and release configurations for all platforms (Win32 and/or x64) you plan to execute scribus on

BUILDING SCRIBUS
====================

After having installed all dependencies:
	- msvc 2008 : open Scribus-build-props.vsprops files located in Scribus\win32\vc9 in a text editor 
	- msvc 2012 : open Scribus-build-props.props files located in Scribus\win32\vc11 in a text editor
Update the dependency paths to match your system.

Open the Visual Studio solution located in same directoy and start building.

After building completed, you will find executables in a Scribus-builds\scribus-$(configuration)-$(platform)-*\
directory, located in same directory as Scribus sources. Those executables will not function yet. Scribus resources and
dependencies must be copied from to install directory first.

INSTALLING RESOURCES AND DEPENDENCIES
=====================================

To copy resources to build directory, create a batch script and copy/paste following lines :

set SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH=.\Scribus
set SCRIBUS_BUILD_ROOT=.\Scribus-builds
set SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH=.\Scribus-builds\scribus-debug-cairo-vc9

 copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\AUTHORS %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\doc
 copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\COPYING %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\doc
 copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\LINKS %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\doc
 copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\TRANSLATION %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\doc
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\scribus\doc %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\doc /s /y /D
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\resources\dicts %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\dicts /s /y /D
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\resources\editorconfig %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\editorconfig /s /y
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\resources\icons %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\icons /s /y /D
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\resources\loremipsum %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\loremipsum /s /y
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\resources\profiles %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\profiles /s /y
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\resources\swatches %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\swatches /s /y
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\resources\templates %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\templates /s /y /D
 copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\scribus\plugins\tools\pathcut\*.png %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\icons\ /y
 copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\scribus\plugins\tools\pathfinder\*.png %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\icons\ /y
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\scribus\plugins\scriptplugin\scripts %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\scripts /s /y /D
xcopy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\scribus\plugins\scriptplugin\samples %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\samples /s /y
copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\scribus\plugins\import\ps\import.prolog %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\libs\import.prolog
copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\scribus\plugins\barcodegenerator\barcode.ps %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\plugins\barcode.ps
copy %SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH%\scribus\unicodemap\unicodenameslist.txt %SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH%\share\unicodenameslist.txt
del %SCRIBUS_BUILD_ROOT%\*CMake* /s
del %SCRIBUS_BUILD_ROOT%\*MakeFile* /s

Adjust SCRIBUS_SRC_PATH, SCRIBUS_BUILD_ROOT and SCRIBUS_INSTALL_PATH as needed and run batch script.

To install common libs:
	- open the scribus-common-libs directory where you uncompressed 14x/trunk libs
	- open the copy-dlls-to-14x-build-dir.bat file from scribus-common-libs directory in a text editor
	- modify the SCRIBUS_DEBUG_BUILD_*, SCRIBUS_RELEASE_BUILD_* and PYTHON_DIR_* variables appropriately
	- execute batch file to copy appropriate files to build directory

To install version specific libs:
	- open the scribus-14x-libs-msvc* directory where you uncompressed Scribus 14x libs
	- open the copy-*-dlls-to-build-dir.bat file in a text editor
	- modify the SCRIBUS_DEBUG_BUILD and SCRIBUS_RELEASE_BUILD variables appropriately (note: enclose path in double quotes if those contain spaces)
	- execute batch file to copy appropriate dlls to build directory

Finally copy Qt DLLs to build directory and Qt plugins directory to "qtplugins" directory.
Scribus should now run.

Crash problems at runtime? Verify that Scribus and all its dependencies use the same runtime, and that all were built 
for debug or release configurations and not a mixture of the two. On Windows, it is strictly not recommended to mix 
debug and release binaries. Doing so is not supported and will usually trigger unpredictable issues.

You can use depends.exe to check that the runtimes match.
