<h2>Hyphenation - Type Hints</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This feature adds sophisticated hyphenation control for text formatting within Scribus. Based on code from both Tex and OpenOffice.org, it has a time tested algorithm for selecting syllables within words.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Hyphenation. Select a text frame, Adjust the text alignment you wish and then select Hyphenation &#062; Hyphenate Text from the menu. Automatic, means just that - select a text frame and Hyphenate &#062; Hyphenate Text sets this very similarly to applying a Style. Changing the font, kerning or font size will automatically redraw the text and reapply the hyphenation automatically.</p>

<p>For most purposes, the settings can be left at the default - Automatic - and then you can simply apply hyphenation by selecting the text box and then Hyphenation &#062; Hyphenate Text from the menu. You can also allow Scribus to automatically hyphenate as you type.</p>

<p>When set to manual, you also have the option to over ride possible hyphenation word by word, as shown in figure below.</p>

<p>There is a sample document included with the documentation <code>hyphen.scd.gz</code> which gives a short demo of the differences when you layout a columns of text.</p>

<p>You will probably have the best appearance from formatting your text as <strong>Block(justified)</strong>.</p>

<p>Currently, there are hyphenation dictionaries in Catalan, Czech, Danish, English, Finnish
French, German, Greek, Irish (Gaelic), Italian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish and Ukrainian.</p>
