<h2>GSview*</h2>

<p>One important thing to note is that <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/gsview/index.htm">GSview</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">must not be confused</span> with <strong style="font-weight: normal;">ghostview, gv and their derivatives!</strong>
Although Adobe Reader® is often a better pure viewer for PDFs, GSview
should be regarded as one of the most essential tools to have when
using
Scribus. GSview has some extremely useful functions. For those
unfamiliar with the program, it provides an easy to use “front end” to
Ghostscript, as well as <code>pstoedit</code> for converting bitmaps
into vector files or vice versa. For those coming from a traditional
DTP background in the Mac/Windows world, it also
provides some of the functionality of Acrobat Distiller.<br>
</p>

<p>You should always use the latest version, at least 4.7. (GSview
migrated from the
Windows world, where it has been excellent since the 4.x versions.)</p>

<p>For use with Scribus, GSview has the following features:</p>

<ul>

  <li>With the help of <a href="http://pstoedit.net">pstoedit</a>, you
can convert bitmap images or PDF content back into SVG and other
scalable vector file formats.</li>
  <li>The ability to preview, convert and add previews (TIFF
recommended) for raw EPS (Encapsulated PostScript files).</li>
  <li>The ability to extract text from a PDF.</li>
  <li>The ability to preview, convert and add previews for raw
PostScript files.</li>
  <li>An easy-to-use front end to Ghostscript’s less well known
features such as image conversion and re-sampling. There are other
features in
Ghostscript, including: converting between TIFF formats, changing the
color depth of a TIFF, JPEG or the color space of an image.</li>
</ul>

<p>One example where GSview is extremely useful with Scribus is
troubleshooting or fixing EPS files that do not display correctly
within
Scribus. Although many applications can generate EPS files, some add
their own quirks into the EPS, which can cause problems when used in
other programs (like Scribus).</p>

<p>So, if you find difficulty with an EPS you wish to use in
Scribus, open the EPS in GSview. Then, use the key command <strong>M</strong>
to display messages from Ghostscript. The messages can indicate
problems which cause display or printing errors. You can also use the <strong>epswrite</strong>
“device” to re-save the EPS, which can help to strip out or fix issues
with an EPS.</p>

<p>You can also <em>rasterize</em> an EPS image, by converting it to
PNG
or TIFF and then resize, adjust colors etc with an image program like
GIMP or Krita.<br>
</p>

<p> Note that GSview uses the <code>libgs.so</code> shared library to
access Ghostscript. Not all Linux distributions ship this, so the hints
for compiling Ghostscript with a paralell install really apply here. </p>

<h4>Getting Gsview:</h4>

<p>GSview is available for most Linux distributions, at least the major
ones. Otherwise you can build GSview by following
the instructions provided in the <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/">source package</a>. For
Windows and OS/2 and eComStation you can download&nbsp;<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/gsview/get49.htm">conventional
installers</a> .
Unfortunately, there is no current version for Mac OS X available. </p>

<p>A special note to users of OpenSUSE 11.3: The required GTK&nbsp;1
libraries are no longer available for this Linux distribution, but you
can use the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/GNOME:/GNOME1/openSUSE_11.2/i586/">versions
compiled for 11.2</a>. You need to install the gtk-1.20 and glib
packages (if you want to build GSview yourself, you also need the
respective devel RPMs), as well as the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/GNOME:/GNOME1/openSUSE_11.2/noarch/gtk-lang-1.2.10-1093.1.noarch.rpm">lang
package</a>.<br>
