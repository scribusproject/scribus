<h2>Color Palettes in Scribus (6): Galaxy Gauge&trade; Colors</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.galaxygauge.com/">Galaxy Gauge&trade;</a> is a company specializing in professional tools for graphics designers, including those working in scientific publishing. Based in Colorado (United States), its main markets are North America, Great Britain, Ireland, and Oceania (Australia, New Zealand).</p>
<p>The Galaxy color palettes included in Scribus directly correspond to the Galaxy Gauge color matching and prediction system, for which printed references are available directly from Galaxy Gauge. A probably unique trait of the Galaxy Gauge color matching system is the ease of color communication between designer and client. Whereas other systems require the costly acquisition of color books, chips or fans, designers can buy printed references for their customers at a moderate price and distribute them via mail, so that both sides actually see the printed colors when design decisions are being made. Thanks to the inclusion of the Galaxy Gauge matching system in Scribus, users can quickly translate real-world decisions into digitally prepared documents.</p>
