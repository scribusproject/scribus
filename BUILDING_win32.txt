BUILDING SCRIBUS ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS
=====================================

STATUS OF WIN32 CMAKE BUILDS
============================

Building Scribus on win32 with cmake is still rather poorly tested.
It's getting there, but for now the Visual Studio project based builds
maintained by Jean Ghali are much more stable.

Known issues with this build:

	- It's hard to ensure that debug libs are used for debug builds
	  and release libs for release builds, as not all CMake scripts
	  do this sensibly.

	- The scripter isn't building yet.

	- The sxwim plugin isn't building yet.

HOW TO DO THE BUILD
===================

This documentation is minimal, and will be replaced by more detailed
information once the CMake-based win32 builds are better tested.

You will need:
	- Microsoft Windows XP (others may work but are untested)
	- Microsoft Visual Studio Express Edition 8 2005
	- The Microsoft Platform SDK
	- CMake 2.5.x (2.4.x WILL NOT WORK)
	- A recent Qt 4.3 snapshot built with Visual Studio 8 2005
	- libxml2 win32 binaries from the libxml project
	- libjpeg sources from jig.org
	- libtiff sources
	- libpng sources
	- zlib sources
	- freetype sources
	- LittleCMS sources
	- PoDoFo 0.5.0 (and ONLY 0.5.0) sources.
	- A Python 2.5 Windows binary build.
          For debug builds, you'll need a release that contains the python25_d.dll .

Some more details can be found below in the section entitled GETTING DEPENDENCIES.

To build scribus its self, you should create a new empty build directory
outside the Scribus source tree. In this directory, create a new text file and
name it "build.cmd". Ignore the warning about changing the file extension.

Open build.cmd in a text editor, and paste the following into it:

rem Dependency paths:
set CMAKE=C:\Program Files\CMake 2.5\bin\cmake.exe

The above script is designed to work with common arrangements of library
install directories, both build trees and installed copies. If you follow the
instructions here about setting up the libraries scribus requires, you should
be OK. [SEE: GETTING DEPENDENENCIES]

Update the dependency paths to match your system.  Now open a cmd.exe window,
cd into the build directory, and run build.cmd . If all goes well, it'll find
your libraries and exit successfully.
(Note: Some systems could have some environment related problems running this
from simple cmd.exe. Use SDK console instead then.)

Open the solution that CMake generated in Visual Studio and build it. On
Windows it's easier to do a release build as you don't need to build a debug
Qt, python, etc. 

If it all builds, manually build the INSTALL project to trigger an install. Now
copy the DLLs from the zlib, libpng, qt, lcms, freetype, libtiff, libjpeg,
libxml, and podofo directories into the Scribus install directory (where
scribus.exe is). It should now run.

Crash problems at runtime? Verify that Qt, freetype, lcms, and Scribus all use
the same runtime, and that all were built for debugging or all for release not
a mixture of the two. Windows does not permit you to mix debug and release
executables like other platforms do.

You can use depends.exe to check that the runtimes match.

GETTING DEPENDENCIES
====================

This is a quick and dirty set of notes that will be filled out once everything's
verified as correct and working. It asssumes that you'll be building all your
dependencies at a single root, like C:\Developer. The root *MUST* not have spaces
in its path.

----
Qt:

Download the latest qt 4.3 snapshot for windows and unpack it to C:\Developer .
Don't get the "all" snapshot, it lacks configure.exe  and can't easily be built
on Windows.

Start a command line and import your Visual Studio environment:
\path\to\visual\studio\VC\vcvarsall.bat
\path\to\platform\sdk\setenv.cmd

now cd to C:\Developer\Qt-win-whatever and run configure:
configure -debug-and-release -fast -no-qt3support -platform win32-msvc2005

and nmake.

----

zlib:

download the sources from from www.zlib.net and unpack to your main
libraries directory. Rename the unpacked sources directory to "zlib".
libpng relies on this.

Don't bother building it. libpng will do that for us.

[TODO: use Qt zlib]

----

libpng:

get sources from:
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

unpack with the same parent directory as zlib.

open projects\visualc71\libpng.sln
upgrade
build "Release DLL"
build "Debug DLL"

**WARNING**
If you build libpng and zlib with Visual Studio 8, you will
get DLLs with the official names, but they will not be fully
binary compatible with the official DLLs. We can get away
with using them privately for Scribus, but for a release
it's recommended that you rebuild the DLLs with different
names.
**WARNING**

[TODO: use Qt libpng]

----

jpeg:

Get jpeg sources from jig.org . Unpack to your libraries directory.
Now, in a command prompt:

cd 
copy Makefile.vc Makefile
copy jconfig.vc jconfig.h
nmake

(you might have to use vcvars.bat from vc and setvars.bat from the platform sdk)


----

lcms:

Get lcms sources.
Build using VC project in Projects dir. Only build the DLL
(right click -> build on lcmsdll).

Now modify lcms.h and remove:

#define unlink _unlink

You must modify lcms.h to prevent it from defining `cdecl'. [TODO: other
changes] [ TODO: line numbers / patch ]. This is only required to use the
header with Scribus; it's Ok to use a library built without these changes.


----

Libtiff

download and unpack libtiff

in a vcvars/setenv window:

set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;\path\to\jpeg\include;\path\to\zlib\include
set LIB=%LIB%;\path\to\jpeg\lib;\path\to\zlib\lib

cd %LIBTIFFDIR%\libtiff
nmake /nologo /f Makefile.vc libtiff.lib

----

Freetype:

unpack freetype
open builds\win32\visualc
upgrade
build "Release Multithreaded" and "Debug Multithreaded"

----

libxml:

download win32 binaries from libxml.org, unpack.
Note that these binaries do not use the same runtime
as the rest of the binaries we're building. Feel free to
rebuild libxml to fix this, but in practice it doesn't
matter since we never pass a FILE* nor do we allocate memory
to be deallocated in libxml or vice versa.

Remember that iconv from the same package must be on the
header search path too. If in doubt, just drop iconv.h
into the libxml tree.




Notes:

CMake doesn't find zlib; you have to tell it it's zlib1  by modifying FindZLIB.cmake
