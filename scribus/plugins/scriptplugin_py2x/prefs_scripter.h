		\warning I'm trying to handle multiple signals via single slot here. sender() Returns a pointer to the object that sent the signal, if called in a slot activated by a signal; otherwise the return value is undefined. This function will return something apparently correct in other cases as well. However, its value may change during any function call, depending on what signal-slot connections are activated during that call. In Qt 3.0 the value will change more often than in 2.x. This function violates the object-oriented principle of modularity. However, getting access to the sender might be useful when many signals are connected to a single slot. The sender is undefined if the slot is called as a normal C++ function. */
