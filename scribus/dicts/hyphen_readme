Readme-Hypenation Dictionaries

We have had bugs reported against Scribus for the lack of licensing for the hyphenation rules. After some research, it seems as they are like grammar rules and not creative element, there are no copyrights or licensing involved. Nevertheless, where they are available, we have included readmes for the various languages.  All of the hyphenation tables have been imported from OpenOffice.org sources.
