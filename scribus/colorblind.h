	For most modern Cathode-Ray Tube monitors (CRTs), the following

	matrices.  They are based on spectra measured on a typical CRT
	with a PhotoResearch PR650 spectral photometer and the Stockman
	human cone fundamentals. NOTE: these estimates will NOT work well
	for LCDs!
	The RGB<->LMS transforms are computed from the human cone
	photo-pigment absorption spectra and the monitor phosphor
	emission spectra. These parameters are fairly constant for most
	humans and most montiors (at least for modern CRTs). However,
	gamma will vary quite a bit, as it is a property of the monitor
	(eg. amplifier gain), the video card, and even the
	software. Further, users can adjust their gammas (either via
	adjusting the monitor amp gains or in software). That said, the
	following are the gamma estimates that we have used in the
	Vischeck code. Many colorblind users have viewed our simulations
	and told us that they "work" (simulated and original images are
	indistinguishabled).
