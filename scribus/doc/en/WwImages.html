<h2>Working with Images</h2>

See <a href="WwFrames.html">Working with Frames</a>
to learn about Image Frame frame creation and manipulation. Note that
the image frame shows as a red border with small square handles at the
corners and at the midpoints of each side. Diagonals in black are drawn
to indicate that it is an image frame. Note that these small square
handles disappear when the frame is locked.
<p>The quickest way to load an image into the frame is to right-click on the frame, and select <b>Get Image</b> from the Context Menu. Pressing Ctrl+I or menu <i>File &gt; Import &gt; Get Image</i>
will also work. A file dialog will appear, showing the image types that
Scribus can import, which include bitmap formats like TIFF, PNG and
JPG, as well as vector/mixed vector-bitmap formats PS (PostScript), EPS
(Encapsulated PostScript) and PDF, which will be converted to bitmaps.
Note that after import the image may only partly show. We&rsquo;ll see below
in <i>Properties: Image</i> how to adjust scaling and positioning of the image in the frame.
</p><p><i>Descriptions, advantages and disadvantages of various file formats will be discussed elsewhere.</i>



</p><h3>The Context Menu</h3>
<table cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr>
<td>Right-click on the empty frame to show its Context Menu as seen to the right. An empty frame will not show all these choices.
<ul>
<li><b>Info</b> gives a short list of information about the image, its
name, the PPI (pixels per inch) of the original and as shown in
Scribus, its colorspace, and whether it is set to print (and export to
PDF).</li>
<li><b>Undo</b> will undo the last operation, which should be indicated. If applicable, there will also be a <b>Redo</b> item.</li>
<li><b>Get Image</b> allows for importing an image, as indicated above.</li>
<li><b>Adjust Frame to Image</b> enlarges or shrinks the width and height of your frame to fit the image at its current resolution.</li>
<li><b>Adjust Image to Frame</b> adjusts the image to the frame. Image will remain proportional if this is checked in Image tab of Properties.</li>
<li><b>Update Image</b> reloads the image. Would be used if you have edited the source file. See Edit Image below.</li>
<li><b>Preview Settings</b> This allows to image to be visible or not,
and if visible, the resolution can be selected. Lower resolution or not
showing images will speed up screen refreshes if this is sluggish. <b>Full Resolution</b> can only be as high as your monitor supports. These settings do not affect printing your image or exporting to PDF.</li>
<li><b>Image Effects</b> (also Ctrl + E) provide for a number of
editing types, like blurring or changing contrast and brightness. These
edits happen in a nondestructive way, i.e., the source file is not
altered.</li>
<li><b>Edit Image</b> starts your image editor as set in the File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;External Tools and loads the image.</li>
<li><b>Attributes</b> will not be discussed here.
</li><li><b>Is Locked</b> locks the frame&rsquo;s position, size, and content.
</li><li><b>Size is Locked</b> locks only the size. Frame and image can otherwise be moved and edited.</li>
<li><b>Send to Scrapbook</b> and <b>Send to Patterns</b> will not be covered here, except to say that these allow for saving content to be shared among documents.</li>
<li><b>Level</b> allows you to move the frame up or down levels on the
current layer. If your document has more than one layer, there will
also be an item <b>Send to Layer</b> to allow moving the frame to a different layer.</li>
<li><b>Convert to</b> gives you the following sub-choices:
<ul><li><b>Polygon</b>, converts to a polygon, with apparent loss of your image, recoverable with Convert to Image Frame.</li>
<li><b>Text Frame</b> converts to that kind of frame, in which case
your image becomes invisible, but will be restored if you convert back
to an image frame. You cannot show text and an image together, except
where text is incorporated in an image. Use a superimposed text frame
to apply text over an image.</li>
</ul>
</li><li><b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b>, and <b>Delete</b> are covered in Working with Frames.</li>
<li><b>Contents&nbsp;&gt; Clear</b> is only present when your frame has content, and you will get a dialog to Ok the operation. There is also a choice <b>Contents&nbsp;&gt; Copy</b> to copy only the content of the frame, as opposed to copying the frame <i>and</i> its contents.</li>
<li><b>Properties</b> brings up or hides the Properties Palette</li>
</ul>

<h3>Properties: Image</h3>
<table cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr>
<td>When an Image is first loaded, the default is for it to have Free
Scaling or as is set in <i>File&nbsp;&gt; Preferences/Document Setup&nbsp;&gt; Tools&nbsp;&gt; Image</i>.
<p>Under Free Scaling the spinboxes are:
</p><ul>
<li><b>X-Pos</b> and <b>Y-Pos</b> - Relative position of the left upper corner of the image to the left upper corner of the frame.</li>
<li><b>X-Scale</b> and <b>Y-Scale</b> - Magnification of the image, compared to its native DPI.</li>
<li><b>Actual X-DPI</b> and <b>Actual Y-DPI</b> - These of course are
inversely related to magnification. Your monitor will still likely be
showing the image at no better than 72 PPI, but this refers to the
final resolution to be exported to the PDF.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, we may have a more or less set frame size we wish to squeeze an entire image into, in which case choosing <b>Scale to Frame Size</b> (or <b>Adjust Image to Frame</b> from the Context Menu) makes sense. Without checking <b>Proportional</b>,
the image is simply stretched to fit the frame and may be quite
distorted. You should find the combination of scaling to frame size
(proportional) and then <b>Adjust Frame to Image</b> from the Context Menu very useful for making a frame exactly the right size for your image.

<h3>Edit Contents Mode</h3>
Enter Edit Contents mode by clicking the icon on the toolbar, or pressing <b>E</b> from the keyboard. Go back to Select Item mode by pressing <b>Esc</b>, or clicking outside, then inside the frame. You will need to have checked <b>Free Scaling</b> in order for this to be operational.
<p>With image frames, Edit Contents mode allows you to click-drag with
the mouse to shift the image relative to the frame, i.e., the same as
adjusting the X-Pos and Y-Pos in the Image tab.
