<h2>PDF Export Targets</h2>

<p>There are basically four kinds of PDF export targets. It&rsquo;s important that you consider the hints below <i>before</i> you start creating your documents.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Press Optimized:</strong> All <a href="importhints.html">bitmap images</a> brought into to Scribus as placed images should have a minimum resolution of 200&nbsp;dpi and preferably 300&nbsp;dpi or more for photos or TIFFs. For line art or vector graphics converted to a bitmap image, an even higher resolution may be necessary for best results. Most vector files can be <a href="importhints2.html">imported directly</a> as native Scribus objects, which is recommended if possible. Output target in the PDF Export dialog: &ldquo;Printer,&rdquo; unless you export to <a href="pdfx1a.html">PDF/X-1a</a> or <a href="pdfx3.html">PDF/X-3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Print Optimized:</strong> This would mean targeting the PDF for printing on an office laser-jet or ink-jet. Recommended settings: Down-sample all images to 300&nbsp;dpi or less, embed fonts and keep your page margins with enough tolerance for margin limits on desktop and common office printers (approx. 6/10th of an inch or 1.5&nbsp;cm). <b>Do not choose &ldquo;Printer&rdquo; as an output target, but use &ldquo;Screen/Web&rdquo; instead, as ink-jet and laser-jet printers expect RGB input.</b></p>
