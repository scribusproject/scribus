<h4>RPM Distros</h4>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service">Open Suse Build Service</a>, we are pleased offer a <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mrdocs/">Scribus RPM Repository</a>. The repository with both 32-bit and 64-bit rpms has updated 1.3.3.x stable and for the more adventurous, 1.3.x-devel versions of Scribus. These rpms are updated regularly with svn snapshots for Fedora 5-7, Mandrake 2007 and Suse 10.+. This includes SLED 10 (Suse Enterprise Desktop 10).  The only limitation at the moment is we cannot provide Scribus development versions for all distributions as they may not have shipped with the latest versions of libraries which our development version may require. Currently, Qt 4.3 is only available for Suse on the Build Server, thus 1.3.5svn is only available for the latest versions of Suse. 
<br />You can use these repositories with <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Add_Package_Repositories_to_YaST">Yast</a>, <a href="http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/">Yum</a> or <a href="http://opensuse-community.org/Smart">Smart</a> easily, as they provide rpm metadata. We use the same build server to provide the rpms for normal releases. For stable releases, the 1.3.3.x rpms have been tested a fair amount and do not vary significantly from the rpms which ship with the distro. If you have any issues with the rpms, please file a bug on http://bugs.scribus.net. </p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of packages in this repository which are built to complement Scribus like GSview, ICC profiles, fonts and some other useful tools and utilities which are not packaged for other distributions.  </p>
