<h2>Scribus on OS/2- Read Me</h2>
<p>Scribus v1.3.3.7 beta for OS/2 & eComStation</p>
<p>
Scribus is an open-source program that brings award-winning
professional page layout to Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows
desktops with a combination of "press-ready" output and 
new approaches to page layout.</p>

<p>Underneath the modern and user friendly interface, Scribus 
supports professional publishing features, such as CMYK color,
separations, ICC color management and versatile PDF creation.</p>

<p>The Scribus Team is very pleased to welcome a release on the OS/2 & eComStation platform. We would like to thank Paul Smedley who has taken the time to port Scribus itself, and those who have ported the other supporting libraries to OS/2. We will endeavour to find and resolve issues specific to the platform when they are discovered,specifically relating to levels of supporting libraries such as Qt.</p>

<strong>Supports OS/2 Warp4(R) and eComStation(TM)<p></p></strong>

<p>Requires libc061.dll - which is available from ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/gcc/libc-0.6.1-csd1.zip</p>

<p>GhostScript is a recommended installation as per the standard Scribus install instructions. Set the PostScript interpreter in Scribus' preferences to point to your installation. Example: the AFPL GhostScript executable from their gs854os2.zip is gsos2.exe. This package includes install instructions (note the GS_LIB environment variable}.</p>

<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul><li>The Qt released on OS/2 is quite old and issues may arise due to
  this fact.</li>
<li>Printing support is not complete, but PDF export is, you can easily print
via Acrobat Reader or another PDF viewer as a temporary workaround.</li></ul>

<p>General feedback can be provided to paul@smedley.info and via the normal Scribus communications methods (IRC, mailing list etc), bug reports should go to http://bugs.scribus.net. </p>
<p>Porter's Note</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
