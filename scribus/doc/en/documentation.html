<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>This section is the main area of the documentation for Scribus. In this section we outline major areas of interest from installation through to getting your beautiful document ready for professional publishing. This area is written mainly by Peter Linnell, one of the Scribus developers who is a professional DTP consultant and wit his help, we would like to think everyone out there can get their publication to print on time with great results. Read on for more, but don't hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Read the last section of the documentation to find out how to contact the team and other users.</p>
