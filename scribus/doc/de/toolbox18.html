<h2>LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a> and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> are two Open Source office suites that share the same code base. No matter which one you prefer, think of it as an extremely useful tool in connection with Scribus.</p>
<p>First, Scribus has some <a href="importhints3.html">powerful import filters </a> for the older OpenOffice.org native file formats, as well as the international standard ODF, which is extremely well supported by both suites.</p>

<p>Second, and equally important, both office suites support a seemlingly endless list of file formats, which means that you can use it as versatile file converter, especially for word processing (text) and graphics (vector) files. Below you find a list of file formats that LibreOffice can open and convert for use in Scribus.</p>

<p><b>Word Processing/Text Formats:</b></p>
<p>DocBook (*.xml), Hangui WP 97 document (*.hwp), Lotus WordPro document (*.lwp), MS Word 5, 6, 95, 97, 2000, XP document (*.doc), MS Word 95, 97, 2000, XP template (*.dot), MS Word 2003, 2007 document (*.docx, *.docm, *.xml), MS Word 2003, 2007 template (*.dotx, *.docm), MS Works document (*.wps), Office Open XML document (*.docx, *.docm, *.xml), Office Open XML template (*.dotx, *.docm), Pocket Word (*.psw), Rich Text Format (*.rtf), StarOffice Writer document 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (*.sdw), StarOffice Writer template 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (*.vor), T602 document (*.602, *.txt), Unified Office Format Text document (*.uof, *.uot), WordPerfect document (*.wpd)</p>

<p><b>Graphics Formats (only vector formats, as there are better converters for bitmap images):</b></p>
<p>AutoCAD Interchange Format (*.dxf), Computer Graphics Metafile (*.cgm), CorelDraw (*.cdr), Corel Presentation Exchange (*.cmx), Enhanced Metafile (*.emf), OS/2 Metafile (*.met), StarOffice Writer Graphics File (*.sgf), StarOffice Drawing (*.sgv), StarView Metafile (*.svm), MS Visio (*.vsd, *.vst)</p>

<p>As of version 4.0, LibreOffice can also open MS Publisher files in Draw, so you can at least convert a PUB file into another format and import the result into Scribus page by page. Moreover, you can open and convert slides from presentation programs like PowerPoint or Impress into a vector or bitmap format that can be imported by Scribus.</p>
