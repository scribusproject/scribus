<h2>LProf</h2>
<p><a href="http://lprof.sourceforge.net/">LProf</a> is an extremely useful tool to make color management work reliably in Scribus, especially for those running Linux or UNIX (but it&rsquo;s also avaliable for Windows and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X).</p>
<p>Generally said, LProf is a very user-friendly tool for creating an <a href="cms.html">ICC profile</a> of graphics devices, including your monitor, which helps to make color-managed previews more accurate.</p>
<p>LProf supports many, but not all calibration devices. Please check LProf&rsquo;s <a href="http://lprof.sourceforge.net/">homepage</a> for a list of supported devices, as well as more detailed documentation.</p>
