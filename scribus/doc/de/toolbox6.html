<h2>GSview*</h2>

<p>One important thing to note is that <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/gsview/index.htm">GSview</a> <b>must not be confused</b> with <strong style="font-weight: normal;">ghostview, gv and their derivatives!</strong> Although Adobe Reader is often a better pure viewer for PDFs, GSview should be regarded as one of the most essential tools to have when using Scribus. GSview has some extremely useful functions. For those unfamiliar with the program, it provides an easy-to-use &ldquo;front end&rdquo; to <a href="toolbox5.html">Ghostscript</a>, as well as <code>pstoedit</code> for converting bitmaps into vector files or vice versa. For those coming from a traditional DTP background in the Mac/Windows world, it also provides some of the functionality of Adobe Acrobat.<br>
</p>

<p>You should always use the latest version, at least 4.7. (GSview migrated from the Windows world, where it has been excellent since the 4.x versions.)</p>

<p>For use with Scribus, GSview has the following features:</p>

<ul>

  <li>With the help of <a href="http://pstoedit.net">pstoedit</a>, you can convert bitmap images or PDF content into SVG and other
<a href="importhints.html">vector file formats</a>.</li>
  <li>The ability to preview, convert and add previews (TIFF recommended) to PostScript and <a href="importhints1.html">EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files</a>.</li>
  <li>The ability to extract text from PDF, EPS and PostScript files.</li>
  <li>An easy-to-use front end to Ghostscript&rsquo;s less well-known features such as image conversion and re-sampling.</li>
<li>Other features are: Converting between TIFF formats, changing the color depth of a TIFF or JPEG file or the color space of an image.</li>
</ul>

<p>One example where GSview is extremely useful with Scribus is troubleshooting or fixing EPS files that do not display correctly within Scribus. Although many applications can generate EPS files, some add their own quirks into the EPS, which can cause problems when used in other programs (like Scribus).</p>

<p>So, if you find difficulty with an EPS you wish to use in Scribus, open the EPS in GSview. Then, use the key command <strong>M</strong> to display messages from Ghostscript. The messages can indicate problems which cause display or printing errors. You can also use the <strong>epswrite</strong>
&lsquo;device&rsquo; from within GSview to re-save the EPS, which can help to strip out or fix issues with an EPS.</p>

<p>You can also <em>rasterize</em> an EPS image, by converting it to PNG or TIFF and then resize, adjust colors etc with an image program like
<a href="toolbox4.html">GIMP</a> or <a href="toolbox15.html">Krita</a>.<br>
</p>

<p> Note that GSview uses the <code>libgs.so</code> shared library to access Ghostscript. Not all Linux distributions ship this, so the hints for compiling Ghostscript with a paralell install really apply here. </p>

<h4>Getting GSview:</h4>

<p>GSview is available for most Linux distributions, at least the major ones. Otherwise you can build GSview by following the instructions provided in the <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/">source package</a>. For Windows, OS/2 and eComStation you can download&nbsp;<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/gsview/get49.htm">conventional installers</a> .
Unfortunately, there is no current version for Mac OS X available. </p>

<p><i>A special note to users of OpenSUSE</i>: Since version 11.3, the required GTK&nbsp;1 libraries are no longer available for this Linux distribution, but you
can use the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/GNOME:/GNOME1/openSUSE_Factory">versions available in the OpenSUSE Factory repository</a>. You need to install the gtk-1.20 and glib packages (if you want to build GSview yourself, you also need the respective devel RPMs), as well as the language package from the &ldquo;noarch&rdquo; directory.<br>
