/**
 * \brief Abstract super class for all Scribus plug-ins
 *
 * ScPlugin is a class that provides information about a plug-in, and a gateway
 * into any plugin-specific functionality.  It should not generally be
 * inherited directly by actual plugin implementations - use one of the
 * provided base classes instead. See below for info on the creation of
 * new types of plugin.
 *
 * Plugins create and return a instance of a subclass of ScPlugin when asked
 * for it by the plugin manager. The plugin manager is responsible for tracking
 * these instances. The ScPlugin instance is used by the plugin manager for
 * tasks such as hooking the plugin up to the UI where appropriate. It's also
 * used by other code that talks to plugins, usually by dynamic_cast<>ing it to
 * a more specific subclass and working with that. The file loader system will
 * provide an example of this.
 *
 * A given plugin implementation's ScPlugin subclass is *not* the best place
 * to implement the bulk of the plugin's functionality. It must be lightweight
 * and maintain as little state as possible. Most functionality should be
 * implemented in a private subclass that is not exposed in the header of the
 * scplugin subclass defined by the plugin. That helps keep the plugin's
 * implementation separate from its inteface to Scribus.
 *
 * Note that the two subclases ScActionPlugin and ScPersistentPlugin, defined
 * below, create two quite different kinds of plugins. One is for import/export
 * of data and for single function actions (like providing a particular dialog
 * or function) which generally do nothing when not in active use. A second for
 * persistent plugins that are loaded (generally when the app starts) and
 * remain resident, possibly active in the background or hooked into many
 * parts of the user interface.
 *
 * More plugin classes - such as plugins for text import and document import
 * - may be added in future.
 *
 * New types of plugin can be created by subclassing ScPlugin or one of its
 * subclasses and adding the additional interfaces required. The two existing
 * subclasses provide examples of how this can work. Of course, once you have
 * the plugin interface, you still need to actually use the plugins. You'll need
 * to extend pluginmanager.cpp a little to handle any low-level init required by
 * the new plugin type (please keep this minimal!). You'll then need to extend
 * the appropriate classes to make use of the new plugin type where required.
 * The new file loader mechanism will provide a good example of this.
 *
 * In addition to the API described here, a plugin is expected to implement
 * the following "extern C" functions, where 'pluginname' is the base name
 * of the plug-in (where the filename is libpluginname.so on UNIX):
 *
 * int pluginname_getPluginAPIVersion();
 *    Return an integer indicating the plug-in API version implemented.
 *    If the version does not exactly match the running plugin API version,
 *    the plugin will not be initialised.
 *
 * ScPlugin* pluginname_getPlugin();
 *    Create and return an instance of the plug-ins ScPlugin subclass.
 *    Nothing should be done here that's overly slow or uses much memory,
 *    and the plugin should not initialize its self here beyond what is
 *    required to return a ScPlugin instance.
 *
 * void pluginname_freePlugin(ScPlugin* plugin);
 *    Free the scplugin instance returned earlier.
 *
 * TODO: better discovery of what plug-ins can import / export what formats, file exts, names, etc.
 *
