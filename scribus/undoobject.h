 * @brief Superclass for all objects that are wanted to have undoable actions.
 * 
 * The most important feature of UndoObject is the restore() method which must be
 * implemented in the subclass. When an action that is wanted to be undoable 
 * happens UndoObject subclass must use UndoManager::action() method to store the
 * action using UndoState object. Then when a user undos this action UndoManager
 * will send the UndoState object back to this UndoObject by using the restore() 
 * method.
 *
 * What is needed for an undo/redo:
 <ol>
	<li>UndoObject creates an UndoState object describing the action</li>
	<li>Sends it to the UndoManager</li>
	<li>When an undo/redo is requested UndoManager will send this very same UndoState
        object back to the UndoObject which then uses it to restore the state.</li>
 </ol>
