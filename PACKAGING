Packagers notes:

* All final release source tarballs are gpg signed to ensure their integrity. 
You can verify them with:

gpg --verify ./tarball.sig ./tarball.tar.bz2

While we also note md5sums and shasums, gpg --verify are more secure and reliable.

* The font sampler script, requires tkinter to run properly and optionally 
python-imaging to enable print previews. Please consider adding these as 
requires, even though configure does not explicitly check for them:

* In the past some plug-ins were distributed separately which are now 
part of the main package. Please consider adding:

	Obsoletes:      scribus-svg
	Obsoletes:      scribus-scripting
	Obsoletes:      scribus-short-words
	Obsoletes:      scribus-vlna

to ensure these old packages are removed on upgrade.

* Currently, the full en documentation is included in the tarball, Please
note it is licensed differently from the application source. We may decide to 
distribute them separately. In any case, a monolithic scribus application
plus docs package should also obsolete all prior docs packages.

	Obsoletes:      scribus-i18en
	Obsoletes:      scribus-i18de
	Obsoletes:      scribus-i18fr

* Some of the hyphenation dictionaries are under the LGPL or other free
licenses, not the GPL. Details for each are in the README_XX.xx.txt for
each corresponding language.

Recommended Spec File Summary: Scribus - Open Source Page Layout

Please remove all references to proprietary applications.

=============================================================================

* We have included a scribus.xml file for updating the mime info database. 
We are still missing some locales, but in our testing it works properly. 
We have IANA approval for our mime type.

An example command to install and refresh the mime database in a spec file 
(distro specfic macros might vary):

%install

install -d $RPM_BUILD_ROOT{%{_desktopdir},%{_pixmapsdir},%{_datadir}/mime/packages/}
install scribus.xml $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{_datadir}/mime/packages/scribus.xml

%post
umask 022
[ ! -x /usr/bin/update-desktop-database ] || /usr/bin/update-desktop-database >/dev/null 2>&1 ||:
[ ! -x /usr/bin/update-mime-database ] || /usr/bin/update-mime-database %{_datadir}/mime >/dev/null 2>&1 ||:

%postun 
umask 022
[ ! -x /usr/bin/update-desktop-database ] || /usr/bin/update-desktop-database >/dev/null 2>&1
[ ! -x /usr/bin/update-mime-database ] || /usr/bin/update-mime-database %{_datadir}/mime >/dev/null 2>&1 ||:
