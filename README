This is Scribus Version 1.3.3, the third release of the 1.3.x development
series.

CHANGES 1.2.x to 1.3.x
======================

Important notes on the differences between 1.2.x and 1.3.x:

1) Because of the new file format features, Scribus documents saved in 1.3.x
   are *not* backwardly compatible.

2) Because of the new enhanced menu/keyboard shortcuts code, 1.2.x  keyboard
   short cuts are not migrated and will need to be recreated once on the first
   launch 1.3.x.

3) On initial launch, 1.3.x will offer to convert preferences to the new 1.3.x
   format. This is recommended. Scribus 1.3.x will store its preferences
   separately from 1.2.x. Moreover, 1.3.2 caches available fonts. The first 
   startup may take longer than anticipated. 


4) You *can* install both versions in parallel and run them at the same time.
   The only caveat is to install them using different prefix/ directories e.g
   1.2 in /usr/local and 1.3 in /opt or $home/bin. You can use the --prefix
   argument to configure to set where Scribus should be installed.

Additionally, Scribus uses a different way to find fonts from Scribus 1.1.1.
To convert older( =< 1.1.1) documents follow the procedure below:

1) Create a document with the old Version of Scribus containing all your Fonts.
2) Open the new Scribus and go to the Font Substitution List.
3) Clear out all current substitutions.
4) Open the Document created in 1) and substitute all the fonts with the
   correct new fonts.

When you now open old documents Scribus will convert all font names
automatically.

For detailed changes please see the ChangeLog.

To use Scribus in your native language be sure that the environment variable
LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG, Qt locale, OR the command line option
of -l/--lang <lang> is set correctly. This is also can be changed in the preferences
 and takes effect immediately.

The EPS/PS import feature in 1.3.x uses advanced features of Ghostscript.  We
recommend ALL users update to the newest version of Ghostscript available for
your distribution. In addition, if you still have GS 7.0x, there are detailed hints on
docs.scribus.net for installing GS 8.x in parallel to the GS installed by your
distribution.

Activating Color Management *requires* installation of CMYK and RGB ICC
profiles. Please see the included help files, FAQ's on www.scribus.net and
http://docs.scribus.net for details. As of the 1.3.1 release,  Scribus ships with
2 icc profiles, which are installed only to enable color management functionality.
The profiles *do not* provide meaningful color management for printing. Additional
profiles are downloadable from www.scribus.net and depend on your hardware and
printing environment.

Other notes/known issues at the time of release:

There is a bug in font outline handling for some fonts in the freetype
libraries. It's being worked on upstream. Don't file a bug report. Instead
change the font used if you need the outlines. This is not a Scribus bug.
Some testing has shown that this bug is not present in freetype 2.1.10+, but
we counsel caution trying to upgrade freetype2. Upgrading freetype2 on some
distributions can be quite difficult.

PSD/CMYK TIFF Support

1.3.2 now has support for CMYK PSD and 8-bit CMYK TIFF support. RGB PSD and
16-bit TIFF support is being developed. PSD and TIFF support includes layers, ICC 
profiles and embedding clipping paths. 

Issue with gradients:

If you have gradient (e.g. with black color) with 50% shade in both beginning
 and end of gradient, you end up with darker center than edges. One expects 
the gradient to have equal shading from beginning to end, especially if there
 is no other color-stops in-between them. This we believe is a libart issue
 and not fixable by us. The gradient will export and print properly.
 The optional cairo build is a compile time option. The is enabled by:
./configure --enable-cairo
The cairo build option is experimental, has not received all the needed
 regression tests and requires cairo 0.9+ or greater. 
Cario 1.0+ is strongly recommended.

Our experimental Cairo build does not have these issues.  We encourage those
 willing to test the Cairo backend builds and report issues to the mailing 
list and/IRC. We *know* the Cairo enabled build is slower, but are encouraged
 by the on-going development by the Cairo team.

FONT ISSUES
===========

There are extensive notes and detailed on documentation on fonts and trouble
shooting of font issues in the help documentation and online at 
http://docs.scribus.net  Please read these carefully before filing bugs.

There are issues with the postscript naming conventions with the Computer Modern
Type 1 fonts, depending on distribution.  In some cases, not all fonts from the
same family are visible in Scribus. We are working on a more complete solution
for the next release. 



BUILDING AND INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
===================================

Please see the files `BUILDING' and `INSTALL' for details on how to compile and
install Scribus, library requirements, etc.

GHOSTSCRIPT
===========

One of the more crucial tools Scribus depends on is Ghostscript. While it is
not required for compilation, Scribus must be able to find a recent version of
Ghostscript at runtime for all features to be present and fully working. In
particular, printing, print preview, and PDF/EPS import will not be fully
functional without Ghostscript. Ghostscript 8.x is STRONGLY recommended.
Support for versions older than 7.07 is untested and Scribus may not operate
reliably using such an old version of gs.

You can get a new version of Ghostscript from http://www.ghostscript.com/ .
There is documentation on how to install a new version of Ghostscript on the
Scribus website:
    http://docs.scribus.net/index.php?lang=en&sm=dtptoolbox&page=toolbox7
or you can just download it and install it in /usr/local, then set your PATH.

If you're compiling Scribus yourself, it will whine at you during configure if
it notices an older version of Ghostscript, or can't find it at all. If you
know you have a newer version installed, run `gs --version' and (on bash)
`which gs' to check what version is being used and where it's installed. You
may need to tweak your PATH environment variable to find the newer version
instead. Note that you can set which version of Ghostscript Scribus uses, and
where to find it, in the Scribus preferences.

Debian users who haven't installed their own newer version of Ghostscript may
want to install gs-afpl then use:
    `update-alternatives --config gs'
as root to select gs-afpl as the default version of Ghostscript to use.

DISTRIBUTION AND OS SPECIFIC NOTES
=====================

Debian
======

If Scribus does not start while complaining about the absence of
Postscript fonts please install either xfonts-scalable or gsfonts-x11.
They are in the "Recommends" and will be installed by all sensible apt
front-ends.

Also see the section entitled `GHOSTSCRIPT'.

SuSE 9.x/10.0
========

1)The littlecms libs 1.10, which shipped with 9.0 does not offer complete 
  support for all the the latest CMS features in Scribus 1.2+. There are updated
  SuSE 9.x RPM's available on the Scribus.net site. We also recommend using the 
  latest version of lcms. 

2)If you are using Qt 3.3.x, please ensure you are using the latest Qt 3.3.2-2+
  rpms. The -2+ versions have an important fix for drag and drop in Scribus. 

3)To enable direct CUPS support which recommended, make sure both cups-devel
  and openssl-devel are installed. Suse enables ssl support in CUPS. The
  current Scribus config checks do not test for this. See the BUILDING file
  for details.
4)There is an issue with certain dialogs in Scribus with Suse 9.3 and 10.0
 and Yes, No order. This is adressed in: 
 https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=119090
 

Red Hat / Fedora
================

Fedora/RH users are recommended to have at least Qt 3.3.2-6. These have
important fixes for Scribus. The Scribus RPMS in Fedora Extras are of very high
quality and have been created with close cooperation from Fedora maintainers
and the Scribus Team. We recommend them for most users as they will ensure
correct integration with the menuing system and mime types.

There are no packages for LittleCMS or a recent Ghostscript in Fedora Core ,
though LittleCMS (lcms) is in Fedora Extras. Please see the included help files
and http://docs.scribus.net for details.
Grey scale icc profiles in images are not supported in this release..

There is a separate file, PACKAGING for detailed hints and notes on building
packages for Scribus.

On Fedora, if you report a crash bug, it would be extremely handy if you could
build a debug version of Scribus (--enable-debug to configure) and get a stack
trace. This is not required, but does help us diagnose the problem more quickly
and reliably. Some information on stack traces can be found here:

http://fedora.linux.duke.edu/wiki/StackTraces

Mac OS X
========

There is also information about building and using Scribus on Mac OS X on the
Scribus wiki: http://wiki.scribus.net/ .

A Mac OS X native Aqua port is in early testing. More information can be found
on http://aqua.scribus.net/ .

Microsoft Windows
=================

There is a separate readme for Windows, please see readme-win32.html


Additional information
======================

More hints and other information are on the www.scribus.net and docs.scribus.net
sites. Full compile, install and FAQ's are available there.

There is a lively on-line community, both on IRC @ #scribus on irc.freenode.net
and the mailing list. Mailing list info can be found at:
 http://nashi.altmuehlnet.de/mailman/listinfo/scribus

Thanks to the many translators, testers, packagers and contributors who make
the Scribus community so special.
